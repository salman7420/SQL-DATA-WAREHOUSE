# SQL-DATA-WAREHOUSE

About The Project:

In many organizations, data is siloed and inconsistent. This project addresses that challenge by creating a centralized data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture. It transforms raw, messy data from multiple sources into a clean, reliable, and analysis-ready format, forming the backbone of any data-driven company.

Key Features:
Medallion Architecture: Implemented Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ensure data quality and governance.

Production-Ready ETL Pipeline: Developed robust scripts to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading.

Optimized for Analytics: Designed star schemas in the Gold layer for high-performance querying.

Technology Stack:
Database: MySQL

Architecture: Medallion Architecture

Data Modeling: Star Schema

Getting Started
